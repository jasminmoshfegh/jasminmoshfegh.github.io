I am an Assistant Professor in Economics and Public Policy at the Business School at Imperial College London. Much of my current research focuses on understanding the causes and consequences of healthcare innovation and the role of public policy in shaping diffusion and access to new medical technologies. 

I received my PhD in Health Policy at Stanford University in 2024. Between 2024-2025 I was a Postdoctoral Fellow at Stanford and a BD-STEP fellow at the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and the National Cancer Institute at the National Institutes of Health.
